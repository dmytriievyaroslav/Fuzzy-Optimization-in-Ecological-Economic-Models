# Fuzzy-Optimization-in-Ecological-Economic-Models
This project involves the development and analysis of the Leontief-Ford ecological-economic model using fuzzy logic optimization techniques. The model aims to enhance understanding of the interactions between economic activities and ecological systems, aiming to promote sustainable development and minimize environmental risks.
# Project Overview

This project implements the Leontief-Ford model enhanced with fuzzy set theory to assess and optimize the balance between economic production and environmental impact. The use of fuzzy parameters allows the model to process imprecise, uncertain inputs typical in ecological and economic data, making the model more adaptable to real-world scenarios.

# Features

Ecological-Economic Model Implementation: A Python implementation of the Leontief-Ford model that integrates economic activities with environmental considerations.
Fuzzy Logic Enhancement: Application of fuzzy logic to model uncertainties in both economic and environmental parameters.
Optimization Algorithms: Development of optimization algorithms that use fuzzy logic to find optimal solutions to ecological-economic challenges.
Scenario Analysis: Tools to simulate and analyze various scenarios to understand the impact of different decisions on both the economy and the environment.

#Documentation

All theoretical explanations, detailed descriptions, and results of the code implementation are thoroughly documented in the file FOinEEM_theory_explanation_and_code_results.pdf. This document serves as a valuable resource for understanding the foundations of the fuzzy optimization techniques applied within the project and for exploring the outcomes of the ecological-economic models developed.
