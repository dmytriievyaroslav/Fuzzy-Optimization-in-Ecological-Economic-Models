# Fuzzy-Optimization-in-Ecological-Economic-Models
This project involves the development and analysis of the Leontief-Ford ecological-economic model using fuzzy logic optimization techniques. The model aims to enhance understanding of the interactions between economic activities and ecological systems, aiming to promote sustainable development and minimize environmental risks.
